## Here I used [`Mumbai Housing`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameep98/housing-prices-in-mumbai) dataset which has the following features:
`Price`,
`Area`,
`Location`,
`No. of Bedrooms`,
`New/Resale`,
`Gymnasium`,
`Lift`,
`Available`,
`Car Parking`,
`Maintenance`,
`Staff`,
`24x7 Security`,
`Children`,
`Clubhouse`,
`Intercom`,
`Landscaped Gardens`,
`Indoor Games`,
`Gas Connection`,
`Jogging Track`,
`Swimming Pool`.


***Here I used [`Decision Tree Regreesor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) to build the model***
## I built the model to predict any house price in mumbai using the following features: 
`Area`,`No. of Bedrooms`,`Loaction`.


## Here in this Project I've used the following Tools for building my model and tried to host in Internet
- `Python`
- `Numpy` and `Pandas` for data cleaning
- `Matplotlib` for data visualization
- `Sklearn` for model building
- Jupyter notebook, `Web Storm` and `Data Spell` as IDE
- Python `flask` for http server
- `HTML/CSS/Javascript` for UI


## Now in order to run the model first you need to download the following files:
- [utils.py](https://github.com/v20131a4463/MumbaiHousingProject/blob/main/server/util.py)
- [server.py](https://github.com/v20131a4463/MumbaiHousingProject/blob/main/server/server.py)
and run them in any python ide which generates the following server :
<http://127.0.0.1:5000>


## Now run the [app.html](https://github.com/v20131a4463/MumbaiHousingProject/blob/main/client/app.html) file I provided to show the following UI will be shown:
